                Hi! I'm Peter. I'm an experienced and passionate software developer with a Master's in Computer Science from University of Southern California. I am interested in artificial intelligence, 
                algorithm design, game development and programming language design. In the past, I have developed databases, designed websites, built automation software, and 
                conducted AI research for Intel over the course of several summer internships. My passion for computer science shows in the ambitious personal projects that I undertake.
                This webpage is dedicated to showcasing my best coding projects as well as miscellaneous projects.

            Use this web app to record statistics of tennis matches, such as points won, points lost, service points won, service points lost, 
            player formations, double faults, and much more. When the user needs to keep track of statistics categories that are not
            provided by default (e.g. was the point won at the net or baseline), they can press the "Custom Statistics Group" button 
            when creating a match to create a custom template for recording different statistics. Match data can be saved into a json file, 
            allowing for the sharing of match data.

            Glass is a programming language designed by Peter Looi that aims to improve code clarity through the use of a novel feature called the fill-in-the-blank.
            Fill-in-the-blanks allow for function calls to be formatted in whatever way the author of the function desires. To define a subarray function in Java, 
            for example, the standard way to do that would be <br>int[] subarray(int[] originalArray, int start, int end)<br> 
            However, the issue with this format is that it does not read like a sentece, and someone using the function would have to read through all the documentation
            in order to find out what exactly each parameter does. However, to define the same function in Glass, the coder would write something like this:<br>
            howto (subarray of *Array from *Start to *End) outputs &<br>
            The asterisk in front of Array, Start, and End indicates that those are the parameters, while "subarray", "of", "from", and "to" are part of the function's 
            "name". To call this function, the coder would write <br>
            MyList = (list 1 2 3 4 5)<br>
            MySubarray = (subarray of MyList from 0 to 3)<br>
            Clearly, this format of fill-in-the-blanks allows for code to look more like real sentences, and it helps describe the role of each parameter in a way that 
            even the most clear documentation could not. Using Glass, code clarity is something that the coder doesn't even have to think about, as the code will always be 
            clear as long as the programmer properly uses fill-in-the-blanks.
